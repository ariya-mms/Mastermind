# Mastermind
A simple Mastermind game coded in Kotlin.
This is an educational project based on an assignment in [Kotlin for Java Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers) course.

## How to Use:
 - Simply enter your guess and it will guide you till the end of game!

## Future Plans:
 - [ ] Adding more game features like multiplayer mode (and maybe over the local network)
 - [ ] Using more functional-style features of Kotlin
 - [ ] Implementing a new design pattern
 - [ ] Using some Java libraries to demonstrate the interoperability between Java and Kotlin
 - [ ] Adding some test cases
